Each student has five assignment grades, and also an opportunity to take extra credit assignments.
The first five grades are the Assignment grades then the rest are the extra credit scores
Each assignment grade is expressed as an integer value, 0-100, where 100 represents 100% correct.
Extra credit assignments will be worth 10% of an exam score when applied toward the final numeric grade.
Extra credit assignment scores must be added to the student's total exam score before calculating the final numeric grade.
Final scores are calculated as an average of the five assignment scores.

The teacher requires that the calculated grades for each student are displayed as follows:
<br>
Student     Grade
Sophia      94.6  A
Nicolas     83.6  B
Zahirah     83.4  B
Jeong       95.4  A
